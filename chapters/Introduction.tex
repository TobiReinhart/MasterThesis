\epigraph{"...theoretical physics has not done great in the last decades. Why? Well, one of the reasons, I think, is that it got trapped in a wrong philosophy: the idea that you can make progress by guessing new theory and disregarding the qualitative content of previous theories. This is the physics of the "why not?" Why not studying this theory, or the other? Why not another dimension, another field, another universe? Science has never advanced in this manner in the past. Science does not advance by guessing."}{\textit{Carlo Rovelli}}

Over 100 years ago in 1915, Einstein first published his theory of General relativity \cite{1915SPAW.......844E}, and still today it constitutes a widely accepted description of gravitational interaction. However, it is still unsatisfactory in describing specific observations. 1998 discoveries by the Supernova Cosmology Project \cite{1999ApJ...517..565P} and the High-Z Supernova Search Team \cite{1998AJ....116.1009R} revealed that the expansion of the universe is accelerating over time. For such an accelerated expansion of the universe to be consistent with General Relativity, one needs to account for it by adding either a cosmological constant or an additional scalar field to the Lagrangian. The entire contribution of such additional quantities is then usually called \textit{\textbf{dark energy}}.
In addition to that, observations of galaxy rotation curves from the 1960s and 1970s \cite{1970ApJ...160..811F}, \cite{1970ApJ...159..379R} and \cite{1980ApJ...238..471R} suggest that to explain their observed rotation behavior most galaxies in addition to their visible matter need to contain a large amount of un-observable hence \textit{\textbf{dark matter}}.
If one wants to describe this phenomenon still in the context of General Relativity, this requires one to add further field content to the theory to also account for dark matter. 

The most prominent General relativity based cosmological model that includes both dark energy and dark matter is the so-called cosmological standard model or Lambda-CDM model. Based on this model, measurements of the cosmic microwave background can be used to determine the percentage of the energy density in the observable universe that is composed of standard model matter and to which extent the additional sources of dark matter and dark energy contribute. Recent measurement lead by the Planck mission \cite{Planck13_1}, \cite{Planck13_2}, \cite{Planck15} and \cite{Planck18} revealed that standard model matter only compromises $4.82\pm0.05\%$ of its total energy content, whereas dark matter accounts for $ 25.8\pm0.4\%$ and dark energy even for $ 69 \pm 1 \%$. Thus dark energy and dark matter combined contribute an astonishing total of nearly $95 \%$ to the total energy contained in the present observable universe.
Justifiably it seems inappropriate that two adjustments that ad hoc are added to an existing theory to render it consistent with otherwise contradicting observations in the end account for the description of nearly $95\%$ of the theories "content".  

Regarding this observation it is no surprise that there exist countless proposed alternatives\footnote{There exist theories that describe the gravitational field as a scalar field \cite{Scalar1} \cite{Scalar2}, theories that use a combination of scalar and tensor field \cite{ST1}, \cite{ST2}, \cite{ST3}, theories that employ scalar, vector and tensor field \cite{SVT1}, \cite{SVT2}, theories that use the usual metric but different EOM \cite{fR1}, \cite{fR2} and even theories that describe the gravitational field by two metric tensors \cite{BIM1} and \cite{BIM2} to provide a few examples.} to General relativity, many of which aim to explain phenomena like dark energy and dark matter without such an ad hoc adjusting the theory by hand. 
Despite this large output in this research area of alternative theories of gravity, there has been no real breakthrough in the last couple of years. 
The deviating from General Relativity into unknown terrain is too often performed in the fashion that Rovelli appropriately criticizes in the quotation above. Changes to General relativity are not performed because observations or even some underlying fundamental principle that one tries to incorporate in the theory of gravity urges one to do so but simply because yet an additional field or yet another structure to describe gravity might seem more appealing than the present one. In short central aspects of such alternative theories of gravity are often postulated, or one could also say guessed. As Rovelli strikingly notes, this is not how science has progressed in the past. This critic is even more appropriate for the complicated endeavor of constructing alternative theories of gravity. 
With the numerous alternatives that have already been proposed and countless many yet undiscovered, possible further ones it is in particular surprising how one might be confident enough to think he or she even has the slightest chance of directly guessing the correct one. It seems more promising to tackle such a complicated quest with a more reasoned plan, by clearly deciding which properties a meaningful alternative theory of gravity must admit in any case and then from there deducing consequences of these properties. 
This approach precisely constitutes a vital aspect of the ideology that lies at the heart of the research area \textit{\textbf{Constructive Gravity}}.

In this thesis, we will attempt the endeavor of supporting the process of constructing arbitrary alternative gravity theories with reasoned structure. 
We are going to formulate certain fundamental requirements that any meaningful theory of gravity must satisfy. These requirements are then cast into a modern mathematical language such that they can be used to guide the formulation of new theories of gravity. This will, in fact, be achieved to the extent that we will formulate a "recipe" that incorporates the precise steps necessary to obtain a valid theory of gravity from a given choice of input data. 

The fundamental requirements that we will adopt throughout this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] \textbf{Gravity is described by a tensor field on a 4-d manifold called spacetime.}
    \item[(ii)] \textbf{The dynamical laws that govern gravity are invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms.}
    \item[(iii)] \textbf{Provided spacetime is additionally inhabited by matter fields their dynamics is causally compatible with the gravitational dynamics.}
\end{itemize}

The beginning of chapter (\ref{chapter1}) will be used to lay the foundation of the remaining thesis. We will provide the necessary mathematics for a precise formulation of classical field theories. Further, we will investigate consequences of the required diffeomorphism invariance of the gravitational dynamics, more precisely we will deduce from it an equivalent set of linear, first-order partial differential equations that the gravitational Lagrangian has to satisfy. The second half of chapter (\ref{chapter1}) investigates the associated canonical formulation of classical field theories, paying particular attention to how diffeomorphism invariance enters such an apparently non-covariant setting. The connection to gravitational physics will be picked up again in the end of chapter (\ref{chapter1}) where we will see how the three different ways how General relativity historically was rediscovered from first principles by Lovelock \cite{doi:10.1063/1.1665613} Hojman, Kucha≈ô, and Teitelboim \cite{HOJMAN197688} and by Deser \cite{1970GReGr...1....9D} can all be understood as consequences of the fundamental requirement of diffeomorphism invariant gravitational dynamics.

The second chapter is dedicated to the connection between the central problem of Constructive Gravity, the construction of meaningful, new theories of gravity and the formal theory of partial differential equations. Not only will we use tools and techniques that we borrow from formal theory to analyze the PDE system that encodes diffeomorphism invariance which ultimately will reveal how at least perturbatively one might always obtain solutions to it, we will also formal PDE theory to formulate the remaining fundamental requirement incorporated in our framework: the causal compatibility between a given matter theory and the to be constructed gravitational dynamics. The second chapter will finally culminate with the concrete, almost algorithmic manual for the perturbative construction of gravity theories.  

In the third chapter, we are going to apply the perturbative construction recipe that we developed in chapter 2 to two explicit examples, namely perturbative metric gravity and the more general case of perturbative Area Metric Gravity. It is of particular importance to note that both two theories represent in no way unreasoned guesses of alternative gravity theories. They are unique in the sense that they both constitute the most general option for describing the gravitational field that is consistent with a specific class of matter theories. More precisely the metric is the most general geometric background that might support a classical scalar field with linear, second-derivative-order equations of motion, i.e., a Klein-Gordon field, whereas the Area Metric represents the most general geometric background for a linear second-derivative-order theory of electrodynamics described by a co-vector field. Thus both chosen examples are extraordinarily interesting to study.

In the fourth and last chapter, we outline the basic functionality of the Haskell library that we developed specifically to deal with problems that arise in the context of perturbative Constructive Gravity. We provide short explanations of the main algorithms involved therein and also supplement the relevant portions of source code. Furthermore, we describe in short, by considering a particular example of how exactly the computer program can be used to tackle the relevant Constructive Gravity problems.

We then conclude this thesis by outlining potential future research interests.

\section*{Notation}

Before we start with the main part, we quickly illustrate the particularities of the chosen notation. Throughout this thesis, even if not stated explicitly, all objects are considered to be smooth, i.e., we work with smooth maps defined on smooth manifolds. 

Furthermore, as the relevant constructions presented in this work are entirely local, we denote maps between manifolds without being too rigorous with the description of the appropriate domain and co-domain, respectively. Hence we might, for instance, write $x^a : M
\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ for a chart map on a manifold $M$ where we should more appropriately write $x^a : M \supset U : \rightarrow x(U) \subset \mathbb{R} $. 

Lower case Latin indices $a,b,c,...$ are used as spacetime indices and hence run from 0 to 3, spatial indices between 1 and 3 are denoted by lower case Greek letters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma,...$. In addition to that, we will use further types of indices to describe coordinate functions on additional bundles that we are going to construct over the spacetime manifold $M$. Upper case Latin letters from the middle of the alphabet $I_k,J_k,L_k,...$ will be used to describe derivative indices of order $k$ and hence run from $0$ to $\binom{b+k-1}{n-1}-1$ where $n$ is the dimension of the base space w.r.t. which the derivatives are taken. As we will work extensively over some second-order jet bundle, we will sometimes drop the labels that specify the order of such indices and hence use $I,J,K,...$ to solely describe such second-derivative-order indices whenever this does not confuse.

There will also be situations with two different types of derivative indices appearing in the same equation, describing higher derivatives w.r.t. the coordinates of the spacetime manifold and w.r.t. coordinates of some additional bundle. We will then label the derivative coordinates of the latter kind by calligraphic letters $\mathcal{I}_k, \mathcal{J}_k,...$ to allow for distinction.

Upper case Latin letters from the beginning of the alphabet $A,B,C,D,...$ are used to label fiber coordinate functions on the space of fields. Whenever we are dealing with a second field that belongs to a different space, we label the coordinates by $\tilde{A}, \tilde{B},...$ . The respective range obviously depends on the specific field at hand.

In this work, we will deal with bundles of smooth manifolds to quite some extent. When we introduce a new bundle, we will denote it as a triple $(F,\pi_F,M)$ consisting of the total space $F$ the bundle projection $\pi_F$ and the base space $M$. Priorly introduced bundles might also be simply denoted by their total space. Morphisms between bundles $(F_1,\pi_1,M_1)$ and $(F_2,\pi_2,M_2)$ are denoted as pairs of maps $(f,h)$, with $f$ being the map between total spaces that covers $h$. Bundle morphisms that cover the identity or such morphisms that are constructed from a given map between base spaces will be referred to simply by the map on the total space.

Given a vector space $V$, a linear map $\phi$, a vector bundle $(E,\pi,N)$ or any other object with a notion of duality, a superscripted $\ast$ on the relevant object will denote the corresponding dual object, i.e., the dual vector space $V^{\ast}$, dual linear map $\phi^{\ast}$, dual vector bundle $(E^{\ast}, \pi^{\ast},N)$. In particular, given a smooth map between manifolds $f : M \rightarrow N$, we denote its pushforward by $f_{\ast} : Tm \rightarrow TN$ and its pullback by $f^{\ast} : T^{\ast}N \rightarrow T^{\ast}M$.

We denote tensor products by $\otimes$ and the corresponding space of $(m,n)$ tensors over $M$ by $T^m_nM$. The space of n-forms over $M$ is denoted by $\Lambda^nM$. Given a bundle $(F,\pi_{F},M)$, we write $G \in \Gamma(F) $ for a section of this bundle. We denote direct sums of vector spaces or the Whitney sum of vector bundles by $\oplus$ respectively. 

The jet bundle of order q over a given bundle $(F,\pi_F,M)$ will be denoted by $J^qF$ and any associated jet prolongation map, either in the sense of prolonging sections of $F$ to sections of $J^qF$ or in the sense of prolonging vector fields on $M$ to vector fields on $J^qF$ will be referred to as $j^q$. 

In general, we will label bundle maps that take values in the bundle of volume forms over some base manifold letters in calligraphic font $\mathcal{L}, \mathcal{H}$ and the corresponding representation in terms of the chart induced volume form by the corresponding standard font letter $\mathcal{L}=L \mathrm{d}^4x, \mathcal{H}= H \mathrm{d}^3x$.

As usual, $\left[ \  ,   \  \right]$ denotes the commutator of vector fields and $\left \{  \  ,   \   \right \}$ the Poisson bracket of phase space functions/functionals. \\
